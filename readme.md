<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Wish You Were Here opens a door into the world of Florida's larger theme parks. It was created for entertainment purposes, because who doesn't like to sit at their desk and think about riding Splash Mountain in the sun.</p>

<p>Utilizing the buttons at the top of the page, a user can load the weather for any zip code in the United States and compare it with the conditions in central Florida. They can also choose up to ten attractions and see their wait times in charming, colorful boxes. Fun!</p>
